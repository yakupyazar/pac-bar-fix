### No need to insert coin!
Pac-Bar is the game you never knew you needed. Perfect for when you're bored at
work or just want to relax a little, it puts the classic arcade experience right
at your fingertips by trapping the beloved dot-munching hero in a Touch
Bar-sized maze. To even the odds, he's only being chased by a single ghost this
time, but don't let this fool you: avoiding Binky is just as tricky as it was in
the arcade classic. Use the warp tunnels at the edge of the maze to put some
distance between you and your red foe, and maybe even escape certain death!

## Gameplay
**Note: A Touch Bar is required to play**

The aim of the game is to eat all the dots scattered throughout the maze, but
beware: if Blinky touches you, it's game over! If you succeed in clearing the
maze, you'll proceed to the next level... which is the same as the last. The
maze can reset an infinite number of times, so keep eating those dots until you
get caught. You can move Pac-Man using the arrow keys on your keyboard, so use
them wisely to keep Pac-Man out of danger. The maze has warp tunnels around the
edges that work in mysterious ways... if you try to run out the side of the maze
you'll find yourself at the other end. The tunnels at the top and bottom
transport you not only vertically but also horizontally: if you go up the left
tunnel you'll find yourself at the bottom right of the maze, and vice-versa. Use
this to your advantage if you're in a sticky situation!

## Installation
Getting set up with Pac-Bar is as easy as 1, 2, 3:

1. ### Download the game [here][download link]
2. Unzip the file and move Pac-Bar.app to your Applications folder
3. The game is now installed! Run it from your Launchpad or your Applications
    folder

...or at least, it used to be. Unfortunately, due to apple's new insistence on
[notarization], and my own lack of funds, running the game isn't as easy as it
used to be. Now you must right click the app in your applications folder and
select open.

## Contributing
Moving forward, I will not be able to continue to personally support Pac-Bar.
The last officially-supported version of macOS will be version 10.15.6
(Catalina), although I will continue to accept contributions.

Pac-Bar will always be free and open-source, so anyone can contribute! If you
find a bug please [report an issue][issues], and I'll try and fix it as soon as
I can. Or if you implement a feature, feel free to create a
[pull request][pull requests].
