## Gameplay
**Note: A Touch Bar is required to play**

The aim of the game is to eat all the dots scattered throughout the maze, but
beware: if Blinky touches you, it's game over! If you succeed in clearing the
maze, you'll proceed to the next level... which is the same as the last. The
maze can reset an infinite number of times, so keep eating those dots until you
get caught. You can move Pac-Man using the arrow keys on your keyboard, so use
them wisely to keep Pac-Man out of danger. The maze has warp tunnels around the
edges that work in mysterious ways... if you try to run out the side of the maze
you'll find yourself at the other end. The tunnels at the top and bottom
transport you not only vertically but also horizontally: if you go up the left
tunnel you'll find yourself at the bottom right of the maze, and vice-versa. Use
this to your advantage if you're in a sticky situation!
